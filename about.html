            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Alley Cat Records is an independent, artist-run label and booking collective built by musicians, for musicians. Founded by members of a touring shoegaze band, we understand the grind, the passion, and the community that make underground music scenes thrive. We’re not some corporate machine — we’re artists helping artists, and we believe in supporting bands who deserve to be heard.</p>
